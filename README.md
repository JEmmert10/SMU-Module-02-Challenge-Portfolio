# SMU-Module-02-Challenge-Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to this week's Challenge! This is an even-numbered week, so I won't be given any starter code. Instead, I'll create a web application from scratch! This week, I will build a portfolio page, which I can add to as my skill progress.

### Challenge Elements

challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work.

Each Challenge contains the following elements:

* **User Story**: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
* **Acceptance Criteria**: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work.
* **Mock-up**: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

* **Submission**: You'll submit your completed Challenge for review.

## MY Task

My task this week was to develop my portfolio page. With examples of my work, about me section and contact info. I plan to update my portfolio as i progress through my bootcamp.

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
